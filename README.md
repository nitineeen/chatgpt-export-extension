<h2> Export your ChatGPT converstions to PDF/Docs using this simple extension. (VIBE CODED)</h2>

What it can do!
- Editable in the browser itself!
- Various Themes and fonts to read in new tab.
- Export to PDF via Print as PDF

What it can't do!
- Understand LateX/Mathmatical expressions if any, it repeats them twice.
- I never tried exporting any image containing chats!
  
It works with any AI Chats not just ChatGPT, just click on the extension and *Open in New Tab*, and you are good to go! If it does not work, just copy the *Response* and paste in the editable section. It would get formatted from Markup-text.
